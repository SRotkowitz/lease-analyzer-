#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Late Fee**: Lease allows charging an unspecified late fee ‚Äî this may violate NJ limits.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Entry Notice**: Landlord entry clause lacks notice requirements.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Repair Language**: Lease says tenant must fix "all issues," which may be too broad under NJ law.

#### ‚úÖ Compliant Clauses
- ‚úÖ **Security Deposit**: Clearly limited to 1.5 months' rent.
- ‚úÖ **Lead Paint Disclosure**: Clause included for pre-1978 properties.
- ‚úÖ **Termination Clause**: Lease states 30-day notice for ending tenancy.
